## profile
Hi everyone! My name is Victor Tran (he/him/his) and I am a second year MURP with a concentration in Community Economic Development and Housing (CEDH). Originally from Little Saigon down in Orange County, CA, I have been in Los Angeles for a few years now, attending UCLA for undergrad studying sociology and geography. I am interested in the affordable housing development and housing policy fields, especially as many are denied the opportunity for secure housing and may live in informal, overcrowded housing as they resist gentrification and displacement. Through my work doing research at UCLA, I am also  interested in the ways we can use research and data (such as GIS!) to mobilize community based organizations and inform change and policy advocacy. In my free time, I’m still involved with the Southeast Asian student spaces on campus working on higher education attainment and retention and play wheelchair basketball each week on campus!

## course description
Geared towards urban planning students and topics, this course will give us an introduction into GIS and spatial data science, where we explore tools such as Python to translate, analyze, and visualize data into maps and other materials that can be used in our research and planning practice. I appreciate that the course is geared towards beginners who don’t know how to code yet and will provide us with the basics that can help is in our own work and research.

## project ideas
With my interests in affordable housing development, housing policy, and ways to further equitable development and resource distribution, some of my project ideas include:
- Examining the current geographic distribution of affordable housing units in various cities to see where there is still unmet need to affirmatively further fair housing and if there is equitable housing for all income levels.
- Using data to visualize resource and housing allocation for unhoused community members to determine existing gaps
- Explore suitable land for redevelopment or upzoning that can provide affordable housing or community resources and how that aligns with current transportation systems/job markets
- Similar to the Urban Displacement Project, examine data on and map processes of gentrification and displacement to determine more targeted approaches in areas undergoing neighborhood change

## objectives for the course
With no prior experience with coding yet, my objective is to gain more confidence and experience in my abilities to gather data of all formats, clean it appropriately, and employ various data visualization techniques to make data and research findings more stimulating and easy to comprehend by all audiences. I did an ESRI cartography training course a year or two ago so I am also interested in seeing how data and maps can be used in more artistic forms, creating something beautiful that is informative but also aesthetically pleasing!
